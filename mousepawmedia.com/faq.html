                    We get a lot of questions about our company, projects, and
                    vision. We hope to answer many of those here! You can also
                    find more FAQs at the bottom of the pages throughout our
                    website.

                        What makes you different?

                        A lot of companies are built around the traditional
                        concept of profit. MousePaw Media wants to give learners
                        of all ages and abilities the tools they need to
                        succeed. We exist for them, not the other way around.

                    <div><p>
                        At this time, the only way into the company is
                        through our <a href=/internships target=_blank>
                            internship program.
                        </a> In the future, we hope to open the opportunity
                        for others to come aboard as internship mentors.

                        I'm an educator/parent. Is there any way I can get
                        early access to the games?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Yes! Once we have something distributable, we will be
                        needing volunteers to test out the game and give us
                        feedback. The program is free and has some really
                        snazzy benefits. Keep an eye on our website and
                        social media outlets to find out when this program
                        opens. (It may be a while.)

                        We have a very unusual business structure that is not
                        the least bit appealing to investors in the traditional
                        sense. In fact, we planned it that way. If you're really

                        We're building an open source game engine with a team
                        composed almost entirely of part-time interns. We
                        don't have a timeline, especially because we'd rather
                        do it right than do it fast.

                        Will your games be on mobile?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        While it isn't impossible, we probably won't be pursuing
                        this any time soon. The market for mobile gaming is
                        over-saturated, and developers rarely break even.
                        We'd rather focus on the tried-and-true: desktops and
                        laptops. (Despite what some trendy PR people would have
                        you believe, those platforms aren't going away any time
                        soon.)

                        So many schools use tablets! Are you targeting that
                        platform?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        No. The average lifespan of a tablet
                        computer is less than two years in the hands of a
                        responsible adult. That's a frightening statistic
                        when you think about schools buying tablets for their
                        students. We don't want to contribute to this short-term
                        fad. Maintaining a Linux-driven school computer lab
                        costs significantly less any way you look at it, so
                        we'd rather encourage that?

                        Isn't targeting Linux kinda risky?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Linux is free, safe, easy-to-use, and can be used
                        to revitalize even a fifteen-year-old computer. It's
                        a perfect match for the millions of computer users who
                        can't afford The Latest Trendy Computer every year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We know Linux isn't ideal for everyone, so we still plan
                        to support Windows and Mac, including "outdated" versions
                        where possible.

                        Why aren't you using [major game engine]?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        There are a lot of awesome game engines out there, which
                        have been used to make thousands of totally epic games.
                        Our vision for <em>Operation SpyRat</em> is a little
                        different, both in design and in technical details,
                        and none of the existing engines quite achieve our
                        goals, thus why we're building our own. In the end,
                        we'll also be providing one more quality, open source
                        platform to game developers everywhere.

                        I'm a game developer, and I want to use your game
                        engine, but can't figure out how to get started.

                        The game engine has a long way to go before it's done.
                        It's open source, so you can keep an eye on the progress
                        of the projects, and even help things along if you like!
