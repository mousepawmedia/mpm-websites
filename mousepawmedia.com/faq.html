                    We get a lot of questions about our company, projects, and
                    vision. We hope to answer many of those here! You can also
                    find more FAQs at the bottom of the pages throughout our
                    website.

                        What makes you different?

                    <div><p>
                        A lot of companies are built around the traditional
                        concept of profit. MousePaw Media wants to give learners
                        of all ages and abilities the tools they need to
                        succeed. We exist for them, not the other way around.

                        At this time, the only way into the company is

                        I'm an educator/parent. Is there any way I can get
                        early access to the game?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Yes! Once we have something distributable, we will be
                        needing volunteers to test out the game and give us
                        feedback. The program is free and has some really
                        snazzy benefits. Keep an eye on our website and
                        social media outlets to find out when this program
                        opens.

                        Yes, very soon. Once we feel <em>Operation SpyRat</em>
                        is ready to go live, we'll be launching a Kickstarter.
                        Meanwhile, the best way to support us is to follow us on
                        social media, and to spread the word.

                        We have a very unusual business structure that is not
                        the least bit appealing to investors in the traditional
                        sense. In fact, we planned it that way. If you're really

                    <div><p>
                        Short answer: We're dealing with the quality triangle:
                        we can make it fast, cheap, or top-notch, pick two.
                        For us, high quality is everything, and it has to be
                        affordable for schools and families.

                        Absolutely! We are proud to have a mix of women
                        and men with diverse backgrounds and heritages on

                        we are certain to strictly enforce "equal compensation
                        and opportunity for equal jobs." Anything less would be
                        <em>totally</em> stone age thinking.

                        Will your games be on mobile?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        While it isn't impossible, we probably won't be pursuing
                        this any time soon. The market for mobile gaming is
                        over-saturated, and developers rarely break even.
                        We'd rather focus on the tried-and-true: desktops and
                        laptops. (Despite what some trendy PR people would have
                        you believe, those platforms aren't going away any time
                        soon.)

                        So many schools use tablets! Are you targeting that
                        platform?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        No. The average lifespan of a tablet
                        computer is less than two years in the hands of a
                        responsible adult. That's a frightening statistic
                        when you think about schools buying tablets for their
                        students. We don't want to contribute to this short-term
                        fad. Maintaining a Linux-driven school computer lab
                        costs significantly less any way you look at it, so
                        we'd rather encourage that?

                        Isn't targeting Linux kinda risky?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Linux is free, safe, easy-to-use, and can be used
                        to revitalize even a fifteen-year-old computer. It's
                        a perfect match for the millions of computer users who
                        can't afford The Latest Trendy Computer every year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We know Linux isn't ideal for everyone, so we still plan
                        to support Windows and Mac, with a special focus on
                        the more popular "outdated" versions that so many people
                        still rely on.

                        Did I hear that you're NOT supporting Windows 8 and
                        Windows 10?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Correct. Our software will not be developed for, tested
                        on, or supported on Windows 8, 8.1, or 10. The main
                        reason is the debacle over privacy concerns; both the
                        operating system itself and its Terms of Service (yes,
                        we personally reviewed that document) open the door for
                        massive security and privacy breaches for every single
                        user. We want nothing to do with that situation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Windows 10's compatibility features may make it possible
                        for our games to run on that platform, but users are
                        on their own regarding that.

                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        There are a lot of awesome game engines out there, which
                        have been used to make thousands of totally epic games.
                        Our vision for <em>Operation SpyRat</em> is a little
                        different, both in design and in technical details,
                        and none of the existing engines quite achieve our
                        goals, thus why we're building our own. In the end,
                        we'll also be providing one more quality, open source
                        platform to game developers everywhere.

                        I'm a game developer, and I want to use your game
                        engine, but can't figure out how to get started.

                        The game engine has a long way to go before it's done.
                        It's open source, so you can keep an eye on the progress
                        of the projects, and even help things along if you like!
