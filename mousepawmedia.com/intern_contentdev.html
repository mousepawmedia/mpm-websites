                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        What is content development?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Content development is the process of designing and
                        writing the educational material that appears in our
                        games. <em>Operation SpyRat: Word4Word</em> focuses
                        on literacy and English language skills.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Am I actually qualified?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        If you are passionate about education and have a good
                        grasp of the formal rules of the English language, there
                        is a good chance that you are qualified. Education
                        experience is not required, but it is a major plus.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        What will I work on?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        You will help create the many types of educational
                        content that will appear in our games: expanding the
                        Cross-Indexed Educational Lexicon, crafting sentences,
                        writing and adapting stories, and creating comprehension
                        questions are just a few of the sorts of tasks you'll
                        be working on.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        What will I learn?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        You'll be learning a lot about professional creative
                        writing, storytelling, editing and proofreading, game
                        and activity design, and how to present educational
                        content to learners of all ages, styles, and abilities.

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        What software do you use?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        We do most of our work on LibreOffice (for documents)
                        and Atom (for plain text). We use Nextcloud for
                        sharing files and real-time collaborative editing.
                        Some of our content is also stored on Git.

                        Why don't you use [INSERT SOFTWARE]?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        First, we use Linux for all our work, so the software
                        must work on that operating system. Second, we use
                        exclusively open source software, both for ethical and
                        budgetary reasons. Third, we have to make sure our
                        files are compatible with the rest of the technology
                        in our game engine. Fourth, the ability to learn and
                        adapt to new software is a vital industry skill for
                        anyone.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                        What kind of computer and equipment do I need?

                    <div><p>
                        Content development interns must have private,

                    <div><p>
                        No. We have many reasons for using Linux at MousePaw
                        Media: compatibility, support, maintainability,
                        expense, and privacy being five big reasons. It is also
                        highly beneficial for any modern professional to learn.
                        Don't worry - we'll help you set it up and learn it.
                        You'll be amazed at how friendly and easy to use it
                        can be!

                    <div><p>
                        You need to have a working proficiency with grammar and
                        English writing - we will not teach you the basics. If
                        you already know the basics, we <em>will</em> help you
                        polish your writing to a professional caliber!

                        A lot of our work involves the technical details of

                        vocabulary to phonetics and linguistics. While English
                        doesn't need to be your first language, you must have
                        a solid understanding to keep up!
