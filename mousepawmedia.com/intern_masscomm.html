                        documents, Nextcloud for file sharing, Glimpse for
                        image editing, Audacity for audio engineering, and
                        Kdenlive for video editing. Hands-on training is

                        First, we use Linux for all our work, so the software
                        must work on that operating system. Second, we use
                        exclusively open source software, both for ethical and
                        budgetary reasons. Third, the ability to learn and
                        adapt to new software is a vital industry skill for
                        anyone.

                    <div><p>
                        No. We have many reasons for using Linux at MousePaw
                        Media: compatibility, support, maintainability,
                        expense, and privacy being five big reasons. It is also
                        highly beneficial for any modern professional to learn.
                        Don't worry - we'll help you set it up and learn it.
                        You'll be amazed at how friendly and easy to use it
                        can be!
