                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        What art style are you looking for?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Our character and game animation will be in 2D cartoon
                        animation. Backgrounds and environments will be designed
                        in 3D.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Why do I need to be able to draw on paper?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        At every major animation studio, for both 2D and 3D,
                        work <em>always</em> starts on paper. We follow these
                        same industry standards. Storyboarding, character
                        design, and concept art all ultimately begin on
                        paper before computer-based work begins.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        What software do you use?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        We always start on paper, and use Phabricator Pholio for
                        reviewing and discussing design work. For 3D work, we
                        use Blender. For 2D work, we'll be using our own
                        in-house animation studio software, Lightrift.
                        Additional artwork is created using GIMP, Inkscape,
                        and Krita.

                    <p class=days>
                        Why don't you use [INSERT SOFTWARE]?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        First, we use Linux for all our work, so the software
                        must work on that operating system. Second, we use
                        exclusively open source software, both for ethical and
                        budgetary reasons. Third, we have to make sure our
                        animation is compatible with the rest of the technology
                        in our game engine. Fourth, the ability to learn and
                        adapt to new software is a vital industry skill for any
                        artist or animator.

                        I don't like/know Linux. Can I just use [INSERT OS]?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        No. We have many reasons for using Linux at MousePaw
                        Media: compatibility, support, maintainability,
                        expense, and privacy being five big reasons. It is also
                        highly beneficial for any modern professional to learn.
                        Don't worry - we'll help you set it up and learn it.
                        You'll be amazed at how friendly and easy to use it
                        can be!
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Will you consider me if I don't yet know how to animate?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Yes, as long as you demonstrate a proficiency for
                        drawing on paper, and are willing to learn new
                        techniques and styles.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Will you teach me how to draw?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        While we can provide guidance and resources for
                        <em>expanding</em> your drawing skills, you must
                        already by reasonably proficient.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Will you teach me how to animate?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        We can certainly show you the ropes and provide
                        resources for learning more. Our management staff
                        knows how the process works, but since it isn't our
                        primary skill, you'll need to bring your own
                        artistic talent and vision to the table to make
                        it really sparkle.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Why aren't you animating the whole game in 3D?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        We use 3D (Blender) to create background images for our
                        game locations. However, we have decided not to
                        animate the characters or design the actual game in
                        3D. This is first a technical decision, since 3D games
                        require more powerful computers than many of our
                        clients have. Second, due to the complexity of the
                        style, it is a lot harder to get 3D <em>right</em>,
                        and we need quality!
