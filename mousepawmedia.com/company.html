                <h2>History</h2>
                <img class='med framed float_left' src='/img/photos/jason_annie_2016.jpg'>
                <p>
                    MousePaw Media, originally MousePaw Games, was founded in
                    2010 by Jason C. McDonald. In 2009, he had relaunched a free
                    web game, Remmie and the Lab Rats, based on a 2006 project.
                    The game appeared on his now-closed children's website
                    KidMagine.com. While the website's low traffic didn't afford
                    Lab Rats much exposure, it was met with rave reviews from
                    its audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a year of planning and experimentation, he asked
                    freelance editor and author Anne McDonald to join the
                    project as Lead Content Developer, and later, Chief
                    Operations Officer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the help of some very creative friends, the team had
                    completed Word4Word ALPHA 1, the first fully-playable
                    prototype of the game, which was also Jason's senior
                    project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Starting in 2013, MousePaw Games expanded its team, starting
                    the internship program, which offers a year-long
                    internship to college students and recent
                    graduates, fast-tracking their entry into game design and
                    software development fields.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In early 2017, the company adopted the primary name
                    'MousePaw Media' to better cover the wide range of
                    current and future projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2019, the internship program was expanded to include
                    applicants from around the world, and the team moved to
                    an exclusively remote, distributed model.

                <h2>Code of Ethics</h2>
                <p>
                    MousePaw Media is dedicated to encouraging learning and
                    creativity in people of all ages, especially children. Our
                    ethical principles are intended to guide our actions and
                    decisions towards this goal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While commercial and financial success is desirable, it is
                    not to be pursued to the detriment of the company’s ethics.
                    The company should place PEOPLE OVER PROFIT, seeking the
                    well-being of its customers and employees first and
                    foremost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We aim to create an environment which embraces DIVERSITY
                    and INCLUSION by fostering a safe workplace and community.
                    This also means taking an active role in eliminating
                    discrimination and intolerance in any situation we are in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is never a reason to cut corners, and “good enough” is
                    never good enough. Employees and managers should be diligent
                    in pursuit of QUALITY, taking the extra time and effort to
                    create a polished, high quality product worthy of our
                    customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mistakes are a natural part of growth. Each individual in
                    the company should be HONEST about and WILLING TO LEARN from
                    these mistakes. There is never a good reason to excuse and
                    cover up mistakes. Each individual should also continually
                    seek to expand his or her abilities and knowledge in their
                    relevant field(s).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Good COMMUNICATION is vital to a team’s success, and the
                    company should make every effort to foster and promote
                    natural and healthy communication between employees,
                    managers, and as appropriate, customers. Managers should be
                    diligent in ensuring that company policies do not inhibit
                    collaboration and the free and open exchange of ideas within
                    the company, within reason.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Employees and representatives of the company should exhibit
                    RESPECT and WISDOM in their words and deeds, being mindful
                    and sensitive to others viewpoints, ideas, and opinions, and
                    taking into consideration the possible repercussions of
                    their words and actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HONESTY and FAIRNESS should be present in all of the
                    company’s policies and actions, never deliberately
                    misleading, manipulating, or discriminatory. It should seek
                    outcomes that are just and evenhanded for all parties
                    involved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each individual in the company should take RESPONSIBILITY
                    for his or her words, actions, and work, and the company
                    should take responsibility for its representatives.
