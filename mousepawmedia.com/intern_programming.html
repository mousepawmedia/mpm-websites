                        What will I be coding?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        It depends on your specific talents and interests as
                        a programmer. We have two major projects right now,
                        and dozens of diverse tasks therein.

                    <div><p>
                        We do most of our programming in C++ and Python,
                        with some C and Bash. We also use HTML, CSS,
                        and ReStructuredText.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Will you consider me if I use [INSERT LANGUAGE]?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Yes, as long as you're willing to learn something new.
                        Several of our interns used only Java prior to coming
                        aboard.

                    <div><p>
                        All our work takes place on Debian-based Linux (i.e.
                        Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Debian, etc.) We use the Clang
                        compiler for C and C++. Our technology stack and tools
                        are all 100% open source software. You can find a

                    <p class=days>
                        I don't like Linux. Can I just use [INSERT OS]?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        No. We have many reasons for using Linux as our
                        development environment, compatibility being a big
                        one. It is also a vital industry skill to be able to
                        use Linux. In short, it is mandatory.
                    </p></div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Why don't we use [insert technology here]?

                    <div><p>
                        We have carefully selected each of our technologies,
                        based on multiple criteria. While we are <em>not</em>
                        closed to suggestions, be aware that we've already
                        considered most popular technological options.

                    <div><p>
                        There are a lot of fantastic books and online courses
                        to teach you the basics of programming, and thousands
                        of open source projects with which to get your feet
                        wet! Once you have the basics down, come talk to us.

                <p class=center>(Click a question to view the answer.)</p>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Do you use source control?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Yes. We have a full Git repository system, with pre- and
                        post-commit code review tools and linters via a platform
                        called Phabricator.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Can you make a build in one step?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Yes. Our code projects use CMake and Makefiles to allow
                        building with one command.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Do you make daily builds?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Yes. Every time code is committed for the mandatory
                        pre-commit review, it is automatically built by Jenkins.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Do you have a bug database?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Yes. Our task list has an integrated bug database, and that
                        in turn links to all the code review tools. It's a
                        beautiful thing.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Do you fix bugs before writing new code?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Yes, as much as is sane. There is no such thing as "perfect
                        code," but it has to be stable and work well before we add
                        to it.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Do you have an up-to-date schedule?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Yes. We try to keep our task list carefully maintained and
                        prioritized, and it has a number of tools for scheduling
                        tasks in a programmer-friendly sort of way.

                    <div><p>
                        Yes. We have a wiki that hosts as our specs, which means
                        that we can continually revise as we learn. Our specs are
                        living documents - as we garner the necessary information
                        to make informed decisions, we update and expand.

                        Do programmers have quiet working conditions?

                    <div><p>
                        Yes, in that everyone works from home.

                        Do you use the best tools money can buy?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Yes. We carefully selected the best that open-source
                        software has to offer for development. These tools include
                        Git, Phabricator, and Jenkins. We've also used the
                        expensive stuff enough to know that it doesn't hold a
                        candle to what we've got.

                        Do you have testers?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Yes. First, we have a carefully curated test system.
                        Jenkins automatically runs many tests on code sent for
                        pre-commit review. Further tests can be run manually
                        by developers. In addition, our games go through
                        rigorous testing before final release.

                        Do new candidates write code during their interview?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Yes. You will complete a short coding challenge, which
                        you have a week to complete at your own pace — it takes
                        about two hours — and with your favorite tools and
                        languages, so you can show us your current skills.
                        You will also do live coding in the final interview.
                        (Don't worry; we know how to account for both nerves
                        and inexperience.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>We do not use "fizz-buzz" or whiteboarding challenges.</strong>
                        Our coding challenges are practical and original to us.
                        We also NEVER use code from the interview process
                        in any of our projects.

                        Do you do hallway usability testing?

                    <div><p>
                        Yes. Our team has a very good time trying to break one
                        another's code. That's the best way to test!
