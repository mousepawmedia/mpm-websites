                    We offer internships to students and entry-level
                    professionals. Our goal is to cultivate the skills and
                    character traits required to succeed as a professional in
                    one's chosen field.
                </p>

                    We've worked with students from Eastern Washington
                    University, Gonzaga, Whitworth, and University of Idaho,
                    building upon the skills acquired in the classroom to
                    help our interns transition into the workplace.

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Is this remote?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Yes, all of our internships are 100% remote, and our
                        team is distributed around the world.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Is there a maximum weekly commitment?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        We only ever require the minimum hours each week, but
                        you have the option to work more if you like. However,
                        to promote balance, we have a "soft cap" of eight hours
                        per week; while you can work beyond that if you choose,
                        and it is compensated the same as usual, that
                        additional time won't be counted towards the 240-hour
                        target.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        I'm concerned about school/work/life balance.
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Your academic and personal life are very important!
                        Part of being industry-ready is knowing how to balance.
                        Your internship supervisor can help you with
                        scheduling, planning, and other life skills to aid you
                        in that.
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        Why do you have such a strict interview/screening process?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Two reasons. First, since we're limited in how many
                        interns we can support at a time, we want to ensure
                        this opportunity is open to those individuals who will
                        make the most of it.
                    </p><p>
                        Second, since we're all about career preparation, we
                        want to provide an interview process as rigorous as any
                        you'd encounter in the industry. In many cases, we
                        provide feedback to applicants on how they can interview
                        better, even if we choose not to bring them on!
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        How often do we have video chat meetings?
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        Each team usually meets once a week at a regular time.
                        These are a vital part of our team collaboration.
                        These are scheduled around everyone's
                        availability as much as possible.
                    </p><p>
                        In addition, you will have regular meetings with your
                        internship supervisor, typically every other week (less
                        as time goes on.)
                    </p></div>
                </div>

                <div class=expander tabindex=1>
                    <p class=days>
                        I'm not certain what exactly I want to do.
                    </p>
                    <div><p>
                        That's part of the purpose of an internship. You will
                        have the opportunity to try things out and make
                        discoveries about your interests and abilities.
